## Current Warehouse Processes

### Stock In
1. Upon arrival, food items are weighed using the warehouse scale. Details including weight, origin, signer, and date are recorded on a 'Stock In' sheet using pen and paper. Subsequently, the sheet is filed and stored appropriately within the 'Stock In' folder.
2. Following weighing, the stock is moved to the adjacent sorting room where it is palletized, awaiting processing by the sorting team.
3. The sorting team organizes the received stock into respective crates based on food type.

### Stock Out
4. The warehouse team receives an A4 replenishment sheet specifying the required quantities of each food type in crates for the food bank. As the team proceeds, they retrieve the stock from the warehouse, place it on the scales, record weight and quantity then subsequently load it into the van.
5. Upon completion of replenishment tasks, the warehouse team consolidates the sheet used to record the weight/quantity of stock placed in the van. Pertinent information including the date, total weight, total number of crates, the volunteer responsible for replenishment, and the respective reporting authority is noted on a final sheet that is filed appropriately into the 'Stock Out' folder.
