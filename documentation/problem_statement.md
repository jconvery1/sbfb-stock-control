# Inefficiencies in Current Warehouse Processes

## Introduction

The current warehouse processes for stock in and stock out operations are characterized by manual, paper-based methods that are slow, error-prone, and inefficient. These processes significantly impact operational efficiency and hinder timely delivery of food items to 119 University Street.

## Current Warehouse Processes

- **Stock In**
   - Upon arrival, food items are weighed using the warehouse scale. Details including weight, origin, signer, and date are recorded on a 'Stock In' sheet using pen and paper. Subsequently, the sheet is filed and stored appropriately within the 'Stock In' folder.
   - Following weighing, the stock is moved to the adjacent sorting room where it is palletized, awaiting processing by the sorting team.
 
- **Sorting**
   - The sorting team takes the stock placed on the pallets and organises it into sorted crates based on stock type (e.g. meat, veg etc.), the sorted crates are then placed in their respective location in the sorting room.

- **Stock Out**
   - The warehouse team receives an A4 replenishment sheet specifying the required quantities of each food type in crates for the food bank. As the team proceeds, they retrieve the stock from the warehouse, place it on the scales, record weight and quantity then subsequently load it into the van.
   - Upon completion of replenishment tasks, the warehouse team consolidates the sheet used to record the weight/quantity of stock placed in the van. Pertinent information including the date, total weight, total number of crates, the volunteer responsible for replenishment, and the respective reporting authority is noted on a final sheet that is filed appropriately into the 'Stock Out' folder.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Checking Stock In**
  - *Challenge*: When stock arrives at the warehouse, the process of moving it to the scales, recording the weight and other details, then moving the stock from the scales to the sorting room is time-consuming and laborious.
  - *Solution*: Stock is taken straight to the sorting room, weighed on scales connected to a web application, and moved to the pallets, resulting in less laborious work for the volunteers, more accurate data collection, and less time taken than the current process.
- **Paper Replen Sheets**
  - *Challenge*: Completing the replen using a paper sheet and marking down quantities supplied as we go makes the replen longer to complete. Volunteers can occasionally not remember how much of an item has been weighed and loaded into the van due to weighing multiple items at a time.
  - *Solution*: The paper replen sheet is replaced with a digital version viewed on a web application. Items are marked off the sheet as the team scans barcodes of required crates, resulting in accurate, less time-consuming data collection.
 
- **Fetching Crates In The Warehouse**
  - *Challenge*: Crates in the warehouse usually have multiple labels that display different information, this makes locating correct crates whilst doing the replen difficult and time consuming.
  - *Solution*: The new system would involve the sorting team ensuring that only one label is on a sorted crate, this label would be printed using the appliction and have correct information regarding the stock type and 'use by' date as well as have a unique barcode.
  - *Challenge*: There is often items requested on the replen sheet that are out of stock, the team isn't aware of this initially and will spend time searching through the warehouse looking for the out of stock item.
  - *Solution*: The application will tell/prevent the user from requesting items that are out of stock in the warehouse, this will save time as the replen team no longer have to search the warehouse for items that aren't there.

- **Weighing Crates Whilst Doing the Replen**
  - *Challenge*: The process of retrieving crates from the warehouse, stacking these onto the scales, then moving them from the scales to the van is tiresome and very time-consuming.
  - *Solution*: By scanning crate barcodes and placing each crate straight into the van, the need to weigh crates on the scales is removed. This drastically speeds up the replen and is a lot less tiresome for the volunteers involved.

- **Manual Consolidation of Data**
  - *Challenge*: At the end of the replen, the team has to tally up each of the weights recorded every time stock was moved from the scale to the van, completed by a couple of volunteers using the calculator on their phones. This manual effort increases the likelihood of inaccuracies in reporting and adds to the total time taken to complete the replen.
  - *Solution*: Since the web application records the quantity and total weight of crates supplied in the replen, there is no longer a need to tally these values up at the end of the replen, resulting in more accurate data collection and less time taken completing the replen.


## Conclusion

The inefficiencies in the current warehouse processes for stock in and stock out operations pose significant challenges to operational efficiency and resource utilization. Addressing these issues through the adoption of a bespoke web application integrated with hardware such as scales and barcode technology would optimize operations at the food bank warehouse.
